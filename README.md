# Revamped-Midnights-Website
Updated and improved version of my original Midnights website created in HTML.

During the process of creating this new and improved website, I refreshed my basic skills of HTML, such as inserting text, images, and videos. Even with these basic skills though, I learned new, helpful added skills, such as how to change the alignment and color of the text/images. Additionally, I learned entirely new skills, such as creating a navigation bar that leads to multiple different pages with information, and which changes color both when the user is hovered over the tabs and when a tab is selected. I also learned how to create an image map with specific places the user can click on, a skill which is displayed in the US map on the Tour page. 

USAGE:
Index.html contains the code for the main home page. All of the four files must be present in the same directory in order for the user to be able to properly use the navigation bar and travel between tabs.
